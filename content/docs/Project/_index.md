description: What is the MetaRex.media project? Where did it come from? What will it deliver?

**metarex.media** uses **[MXF](https://mrmxf.com/mxf)** and
**[OpenTimelineIO](https://opentimelineio.readthedocs.io)** to preserve the
original format of metadata for live, downstream & archival use.

**IBC Accelerator 2023** [Responsive Narrative Factory](/docs/ibc2023).

## Rationale

It's super easy to send anything by FedEx - even a baby dinosaur. You put your
stuff in a box and they slap 2 labels on it.

1. The Destination - send to {{% metarex %}} HQ
2. The Manifest - a bar code that points to a database. The record in the
   database says _Baby Dinosaur - do not drop_

Magic happens and the box travels over train networks, air networks, couriers,
bicycles and just gets to where you want it.

**So why is it so hard to send media metadata?**

That's the problem that {{% metarex %}} solves

1. Map the `mrx` container into networks so that destination addresses work.
2. Define a database (register) of manifests so that you know what's in the
   `mrx` container.  

An added bonus is that the `mrx` register can publish cloud endpoints to manage
the metadata - this can lead to **no code integrations**. That should be nice!

## So what is it?

A project to create a body of free to use Open Source software that allows media
metadata to be created, transmitted and stored over common links and file
systems.

## Why do I want it?

Because today, every Virtual Set and engineering heavy production is a custom
build. Every QC report is unlinked to the master content and version workflows
lose metadata when content is processed by third parties. 

* **What is it good for?** Carrying binary, text, isochronous and event driven
  metadata. Identifying the metadata via a registry and providing links to
  applications and schemas that can shed light on how to process that metadata.
  By harmonising the identification and transport of the metadata, an
  infrastructure can be built to keep the stuff that we currently lose.

* **What is it not good for?** We will not harmonize schemas for tripod data,
  lens data, QC data or any other sort of metadata carried. That's outside the
  scope. {{% metarex %}} will carry any metadata through the value chain to
  where it's needed. {{% metarex %}} will identify that metadata and allow
  applications to enlighten the metadata or rmove it based on business rules.

* **What is it *not yet* good for?**: At the end of 2022 {{% metarex %}} is just
  a paper specification, some pictures and a prototype register. At the end of
  2023 we should have code for different computer languages and a framework for
  common tools and apps. By the end of 2024 we should have end to end workflows
  with common tools and a body of free software that reduces the barrier to
  transporting and preserving media chain metadata.

## History

Throughout 2022, at [NAB], [IBC] and the [DPP] Leader's Briefing, the {{% metarex%}}
team did a lot of talking to  content creators, facility owners, software
vendors and many others about what were the blockers that stopped metadata being
a first class citizen. The biggest issue was "_The metadata gets lost_".

{{% metarex %}} was shown to work back in 1998, when the original MXF team demonstrated
file workflows with [metadata preservation] at the BBC in a project called
[G-FORS] (see page 219 of linked PDF). The demo was brought up to date with live
netowrking and VFX and shown at the [ARRI Broadcast Day] in 2019, but in 2022
there still wasn't a similar solution available on the market. Games companies
complained that every new virtual set was a custom engineering job, just to get
the metadata to the right place at the right time.

{{% metarex %}} is in full flight. We need [backers] to create a
financial reserve from which we can give out grants to engineering teams to
create the Open Source that we need to enable free tooling for all. Please make
a small financial or engineering contribution if a working global media metadata
ecosystem is of interest to you or your company.

The project will end in Q1 2025 with the project board deciding on the details
of the project closure.
