The {{% metarex %}} Project is under way and we're about to start work packages.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

{{% metarex %}} is looking for more [backers] to create a financial reserve from
which we can give out grants to engineering teams to create the Open Source that
we need to enable free tooling for all. Please make a small financial or
engineering contribution if a working global media meta data ecosystem is of
interest to you or your company.
