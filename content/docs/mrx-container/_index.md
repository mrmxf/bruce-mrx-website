### The Metarex Container

Start by reading the [MRX container overview]({{< relref
"container-overview.md">}}) that leads you through how we chose the container

the [MRX container specification]({{< relref "mrx-container-wip.md" >}})  as it exists today. It it work in progress
and there may be further detailed discussions in the metarex
[GitHub](https://github.com/metarex-media/mrx-container) repository.
