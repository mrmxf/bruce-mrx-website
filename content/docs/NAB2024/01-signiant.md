#### Concept

Signiant Jet can be triggered to capture live events by connecting to an Arqiva
Live Picture Exchage Directory ([LPX]). An event is selected and an automatic
ETL (**E**xtract, **T**ransform & **L**oad) from {{% metarex %}} provides
native metadata to Jet:

* show descriptive & QC text in the Jet UI for display
* potentially synthesize a live graphic / icon
* import event metadata into Snowflake
* embed the metadata into the essence for downstream propagation

Key Points:

* IMF QC report & LPX data moved in {{% metarex %}} container
* Web Service (metarex core) to validate documents
* Web Service (metarex enabled) to check QC status
* Web Service (metarex enabled) to synthesise svg icons
* Jet / Fight Deck mockup to show status
* Potentially use LPX metadata to show downstream list of captured events
