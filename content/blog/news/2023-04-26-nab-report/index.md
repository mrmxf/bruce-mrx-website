# MetaRex at NAB 2023

New backers, offers to write code, offers of financial support, offers to write
specification, new workflows and generally a thumbs up that {{% metarex %}} is
going in the right direction.

The new backers are being on-boarded and their logos will appear on our
[backer-wall] as soon as the process for each company is complete. The new
workflows and benefits will appear on the website soon and we'll be updating the
spec on the [GitHub](https://github.com/metarex-media) as well as adding more
tutorial material and references to existing standards up which {{% metarex %}}
is based.

## Highlights

As usual, the [Devoncroft
summit](https://devoncroft.com/2023/04/10/full-agenda-and-speaker-line-up-for-2023-devoncroft-executive-summit-las-vegas/)
and the [IABM breakfast](https://theiabm.org/state-of-the-industry-breakfast/)
gave considerable insight into the the drivers and the disruptors affecting the
industry. For me, a key message was that data is continuing to drive business
decisions and that trusting the provenance of that data is key to ensuring the
decisions are good ones. This includes upstream data from the creation of the
content as well as downstream data from the consumption of the content.

On the show floor there were busy clumps and quiet areas. A curious mix of
activity all around. It seemed that anyone with cloud native solutions had a
continuous stream of visitors whereas some of the smaller hardware sellers had
time to doom-scroll on their favourite social media.

Next stop for Metarex is the Media Production Show in London 10-11 May. Come and
see us, we'll [have a great
panel(https://www.mediaproductionshow.com/2023-seminar-programme/metarex-s-fedex-metadata-simplifies-workflows)]!
