# MetaRex at IBC 2023: Responsive Narrative Factory

The **[Responsive Narrative Factory]** ([RNF](/docs/ibc2023)) is an [IBC Accelerator] project that will
be showcased at this year's IBC show between 15 & 18 September at the RAI
centre, Amsterdam.

We're teaming up with [Infuse Video], the [BBC], [CuVo] and others to show what
can be achieved when you mix the following in a simple demonstration:

* seamless metadata handling
* IMF style component based media handling
* great content
* customer interaction
* IBC show guest

Basically **ultra-fine-grained-personalisation** becomes a relatively simple
task if you have all the right components ready to go.

The Infuse video player uses metadata provided by Metarex to deliver the
components of a programme that the viewer wants. No extra storage or redndering
is required - it's just a matter of using the metadata to automate the
preparation.

Technical, timeline and demonstration details will appear on our [RNF] page so
you can follow along and maybe even download the metarex code from our [github].
