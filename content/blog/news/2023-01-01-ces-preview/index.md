**CES® 2023** will take place in **Las-Vegas, Nevada** 5-8 of January and
{{% metarex %}} is going to be there!

It is the most influential tech event in the world – the proving ground for
breakthrough technologies and global innovators. This is where the world's
biggest brands do business and meet new partners, and the sharpest innovators
hit the stage. Owned and produced by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA)®,
CES features every aspect of the tech sector.

{{% metarex %}}’s area of interest will be audio-video, however, all new
 technology are well connected with visualization now. It stands not only with
 TV & Gaming, but also with automotive & medicine, home technology and all other
 sectors that involve moving images and humans. With more than 11 official
 venues and 2 million-plus square feet of exhibit space it may be very
 challenging for us to stay focused and not to be distracted by all the toys on
 show.

Beside the Expo itself it will be also important Keynotes, for example [Dr. Lisa
Su](https://www.youtube.com/live/sRXVRgMF2lc?feature=share&t=887) from AMD and
other interesting Conference presentation.

Here is our plan for CES 2023. We are breaking it down for you so you can ask some questions in advance and we would be concentrate on this and make the most of our four days in Las Vegas this January.

### LVCC Central Hall definitely is place of the interest:

There we will find gaming, metaverse, XR, audio/video and some of our Fortune
500 companies such as Bosch, Canon, LG Electronics, Microsoft, Nikon, Panasonic,
Samsung Electronics, SK, Sony, etc. With too many exhibitors to list here, we
would need to visit the most important and most innovative to learn more about
the latest metadata application.

New LVCC West Hall will feature nearly 300 exhibitors from across the automotive
sector. We hope that metadata will play a significant part in the self-driving
technology, electric vehicles and personal mobility devices.

LVCC North Hall will feature IoT, AI and robotics, smart cities and digital
health. So far I have my doubt if my personal health allow me to dive in the
North Hall, but you never know, it’s Las-Vegas, baby. Perhaps digital health
will also be interested at metadata.

We certainly have big plans for the **Venetian Expo for Eureka Park™**, Country
Pavilions, the Innovation Awards Showcase, and the latest in sports tech,
lifestyle, design and source, smart home, food tech and more. Sports and Smart
Homes would be metadata consuming and generating technology.

The most important bit is a plan to spend a day at **ARIA Resort & Casino** -
the home of C Space, where we can be engaged with the marketing, advertising,
media and entertainment communities. One of the biggest C Space events to date,
exhibitors will include Amazon Advertising, Google, LG Ads, Microsoft,
NBCUniversal, Netflix, The Nielsen Company, Omnicom Media Group, Pandora, Roku,
Samsung Ads, SiriusXM, Snap, T-Mobile, TikTok, Warner Bros. and more.
