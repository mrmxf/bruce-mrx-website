# Making Rex, Insights from our Creative Team

### Meet the creatives behind Rex:

**[Amber Bardell]** is a multidisciplinary creative with a passion for tactile
art techniques. You’ll often find them painting walls, or canvas. Their trusty
iPad is the digital canvas where most of the MetaRex visual concepts begin.

**[Simi Zeko]** is a Graphic Designer who enjoys problem solving in many forms.
Always looking for the next opportunity to try something new and explore what
technology can bring to the process.

Creating **Rexy**, our endearing green dinosaur, has been a journey of
innovation. As a pair, we have created a workflow that prioritises both of our
strengths and feels quite natural to bring with us wherever we may be when
remote working. So far, we have used Photogrammetry, virtual reality sculpting
and AI powered animation. MetaRex has been an opportunity to explore how new
ways of working can be integrated into the pipeline, making more room for the
collaboration of our disciplines.

We wanted Rex to feel familiar and friendly, but with a slight edge that
could scare other characters in her world when he gets protective of his
metadata. The process of bringing her to life began with discussions and Amber’s
sketches, usually digital but sometimes scrawled on paper scraps. In line with
Amber’s penchant for tactile mediums, they initially modelled Rex in plasticine.
Simi then used photogrammetry to create a 3D model and we worked together to
adjust her shape to perfection using 3D software. As we’ve continued to develop
our workflow, we’ve also been using VR to model the initial shapes of 3D assets.
Rex is still a very young dinosaur, so expect to see some character development!

 For the scenery, Amber usually makes a plan of the whole scene and then gets
stuck right into individual assets. Their illustrative style for this project
uses chunky black lines and bright, layered colours. Simi takes these digital
drawings and starts mocking up a scene in Unreal Engine. This way, we can
continually make adjustments and update the assets as much as we like, seeing
how they interact with Rex and the environment as a whole.

Our concept for the visual style of the scenery is largely influenced by using
2D elements in a 3D space. We wanted to prioritise hand-drawn, painterly
elements instead of making a photorealistic landscape, so we took inspiration
from theatre. Thinking of our environmental assets as stage flats meant we could
create a complex and interesting scene that feels playful, familiar, and gives a
nod to the performing arts. We have married this simple approach with dynamic
elements such as caustics and volumetric fog for more visual interest.

An important part of the project is being able to extract engine data from
Unreal and pass it on to the MetaRex software developers for testing. We first
created a custom component that tracks any chosen point or object. This location
data per frame is then exported to a spreadsheet upon rendering the sequence.
The component is flexible and can be adapted to track whatever data is required
from an Unreal Engine sequence. We also use a post process material to create a
custom stencil which adds transparency to the final output. A subtle numbered
pattern is included to differentiate between objects as they overlap.

It is exciting to be using our strengths and constantly learning new things in
this project, we look forward to sharing new test pattern scenes in the coming
months!
