# MetaRex at the Media Production Show 2023

The **Media Production and Technology Show** takes place on the 10th & 11th of
May, at [Olympia](https://goo.gl/maps/eLfifzhXA63WTkYE6) in London. We're
thrilled to be one of the exhibitors at booth **H.24** in this year's event
where we'll launch the [Metarex Project](/) officially.

This leading industry event will bring together experts and innovators in
production and media technology for two days. There is an impressive line-up of
exhibitors and speakers, including our Executive Director Bruce Devlin. He will
be hosting a discussion on Metarex with an [inspiring
panel](https://www.mediaproductionshow.com/2023-seminar-programme/metarex-s-fedex-metadata-simplifies-workflows),
including representatives from Garden Studios, Eluvio, Anna Valley and Mo-Sys
Engineering, starting at 16:00 – 16:30 on the 11th of May.

If you need refreshment after the excitement of the first day, please join us
for **after-show drinks** at the [Hand and
Flower](https://goo.gl/maps/eLfifzhXA63WTkYE6), opposite Olympia, from 5pm until
late on the 10th of May. If you would like to attend, please e-mail
