MXF-Live was demonstrated at the [ARRI International Broadcast Day
2019](https://www.arri.com/en/solutions/broadcast/broadcast-day-2019).

## Live Metadata Capture and Rendering in MXF

This 2 year project was a pre-cursor to **[metarex]**

Ideal for semi-custom metadata such as position,  logging, device parameters
**Shoot** with on-set metadata from devices and from humans<br>
**Wrap** the metadata in MXF using open standards<br>
**Move** the video, audio and metadata over a standard IP network<br>
**Store** the stream as an open MXF file with enhanced metadata<br>
**Share** the content live and in files environments re-wrapping

### What is it?

An existing open standard for transporting containers of synchronous metadata
over IP networks for use in both live and file environments.

An [Arri] Camera and Head sent MXF containers over IP. These were multiplexed
with Metadata from the [Trackmen] system that gather pan, tilt, yaw, zoom,
position, and lens metadata. [Nablet] software managed MXF multiplexing and
demultiplexing as well as serialising the MXF from the network into a file that
could be opened in Avid.

<a id="why" ></a>

### Why?

Many productions have rich metadata such as lens information, gimble telemetry,
camera position information, shot logging and other bulky metadata that is
created. The workflows to get it into the show are often ad-hoc. This project
uses open standards to preserve metadata in a way that minimises re-wrap and
re-engineering the data.

<a id="who" ></a>

### Who?

Led by **[Arri]**, the team included **[Nablet]**, **[Trackmen]**,
**[Fusionmedia]** and **[Mr MXF]** as coordinator. What's Next? The system
works and we're looking for partners to develop a framwework for handling any
kind of metadata. See the [metarex] website for details
