The DPP Leaders briefing is one of the must-attend events of the year. A truly
international crowd with awesome speakers and a great 2 day narrative including
futurology, current challenges, diversity, equality, inclusivity, sustainability
and of course metadata.

I can't blog about what was said on the stage, but I can say that the importance
of metadata was agreed, but all. Chris and I asked the same questions that I
asked at [NAB] and [IBC] and the resounding Yes response confirmed that the {{%
metarex %}} project continues to be needed. Looks like December and January are
going to be busy.
