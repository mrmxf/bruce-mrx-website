# Responsive Narrative Factory is the best IBC Accelerator 2023

{{%  metarex %}} teamed up with [Infuse Video] to lead the 2023 IBC Accelerator
Project - Responsive Narrative Factory. Guided by our champions, the [BBC] and
[theIET], we sought to deliver a hyper-personalised experience based on
individual choices that was delivered by a metadata driven software pipeline.

Don't like the Bunny in Big Buck Bunny - _that's fine_. Don't like nature
programs where baby birds get eaten - _fine too_. Only got 10 minutes to watch a
90 minute football match - _no worries_!

With the help of [Cuvo], [EZDRM]. [JPBMedia] and the [IBC Accelerator] Team
the [online demo] sparked joy with hundreds of visitors to the booth at the
show.
