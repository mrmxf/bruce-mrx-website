### Metaverse and Metadata at CES® 2023

The CES 2023 theme was a little unusual for consumer tech show, but it was up to
date, relevant and contemporary: **“Tech Solving the World’s Biggest
Challenges”**. Tech development is often associated with poor environment
credentials or not in the long term interest of humanity, but perhaps only now
we are entering an age where technology could help save the world in many ways
broken by human interaction.

One of the six most important tech trends nominated by Steve Koenig, VP Research
for CTA was **Metaverse / Web3.0**.
**[Koenig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp3SqNVRM68)** said that we will see
legit substance forming around the Metaverse in both tech innovation and
business strategy. As examples he offered

* Visualization by [TouchCast](https://touchcast.com/touchcast-home)
* Digital Scent by[OVR technology](https://ovrtechnology.com/)

both of which enhance the audio-video experience we have bee used to have until
now.

The show floor saw VR/AR offering – filming, delivering, reproducing
all sorts of content – for business purposes and entertainment. There were many
3D metadata tools including one we liked from [Vimmerse](https://www.vimmerse.net/).

The conference session also had Metaverse topics with important speakers and well
knowing innovators such as...

* _The road to the open Metaverse_,
* _Influencers and Actors in the Metaverse_
* _Metaverse meets Office Space_

However, the most important for {{% metarex %}} project appears to be the
Conference Stream at the Aria conference centre:

* _Hollywood streaming and Metaverse_

where we met a plethora of like minded colleagues, including Leslie Shannon -
Head of Ecosystem and Trend Scouting for Nokia based in Silicon Valley and the
author of **[Interconnected Realities]**:
_How the Metaverse Will Transform Our Relationship to Technology Forever_

Needless to say that engineering part of Metaverse today in term of
standartization is much weaker than the futurist dreams about it, so here we
are: Closing the gap. Metarex roar!
