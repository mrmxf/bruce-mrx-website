# XR, Metaverse and Metadata at NAB 2023

The unofficial theme of the Centennial NAB 2023 "Data", to be even more precise
it's _metadata_ and this should not be surprising. Since video and audio become
have become digital, there's an increasing need to know more about the content
you have. Whether it's how it was made, where it came from, who owns it, how
fast you can move it and whether it can pass QC in a given territory. Metadata
plays increasingly important role in production, post-production, and most
importantly **the monetization** of the content. In the **NexGenTV**, remote
production, XR and virtualization, the accuracy of Metadata is playing the most
important role.

NAB show offering the two hours of show floor tours: “**The Data, Data, Data
Tour**” happens twice a day (10-12 and 13-15) on Monday 17 and Tuesday 18 and on
Sunday 16 one tour from 10:30 till 12:30. Plus there's the very impressive panel
discussion with the same title at the Conference on Monday. We recommend the
tour because it will show you why Metarex is important.

The panel announcement says:

> “Data drives virtually every corner of
entertainment from idea inception, production, and distribution to ultimately
understanding audience behavior.What is the best way to implement & leverage
‘intelligent data,’ so you can scale and monetize your assets? How does the
content ecosystem process all these enormous volumes of information to drive
towards scale and profitability?

>The visionaries and experts will discuss a variety of ways companies are using
AI and metadata to create new opportunities, drive towards sustainable business
practices, and grow their audiences.”

Also there will be several presentations in the open theatres on this theme,
such as  11:00- 11:20 presentation “**Unified Entertainment Data Architecture -
Real World Benefits**” on Monday at W3421E Connect Innovation Theatre or  13:00-
13:40 “**End-to-end Production in the Cloud with Real-Time Artist Collaboration**”
on Tuesday 18 at W1143C Intelligent Content Experimental Zone. All the news from
the show floor and conference on metadata you will find here at  our Metarex
Resource.

However, the best event we are inviting you to participate in will be Metarex
project meeting at our backer Signiant's booth on the last day of the show
Wednesday 19. Please come to W1713 to learn about new free software and
standardization initiative which will make your life is much easy. **Metadata
Resource Express** is coming to NAB 2023!
